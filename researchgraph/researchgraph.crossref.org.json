"abstract": "Following the development of online sites dedicated to the preservation of in iduals’ photographic and textual memorialisation of cities, a number of archiving sites using Facebook have been developed that cater to the interactive and co-creative practice of memorialising LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) city-based communities, events and public spaces (e.g. Lost Gay Perth and Lost Gay Melbourne). Such minority community practices of memorialisation invoke deeply felt and affective attachments to ‘past’ in ways which have implications for identity, belonging, ageing and agency. This article utilises a critical approach to archiving, temporality, identity and attachment to interrogate some of the ways in which digital cultural practices related to archiving social networking sites are implicated in the memorialisation of community belonging through notions of past, networks of knowing, and the temporal and historical production of ways of thinking about and knowing minority sexuality, particularly LGBTQ subjectivity.",

"abstract": "Men's elite team sports in Australia have recently been the subject of considerable public scrutiny subsequent to a series of instances of group sexual violence against women. Both scholarship and policy work have noted how homosocial institutions such as sporting teams have a greater likelihood of gender-based violence and have proposed the need for more ethical relations. This article explores some of the ways in which group sexual assault can be approached from the perspective of Judith Butler's theories of performativity. Arguing that the performance of subjectivity occurs differentially in highly bonded group contexts, cases of sexual assault by team sportsplayers can be understood as the result of a team’s group subjective suspension of ethics occurring in the temporality of off-field bonding. By developing alternative ways in which to understand the distinction between in idual responsibility and local group subjectivity, it is argued that sportsplayers are well-placed to recognise the vulnerability of victims through their own vulnerability to injury and loss, thereby presenting the space for an ethics of non-violence that is grounded in recognition of the vulnerable other.",

"abstract": "This article examines the ways in which recent theorizations of interactivity work to reconceive the author-text-audience relationship. Suggesting that all media forms - historical and contemporary - can be reconceptualized in light of recent understandings of interactivity, it is argued that control over the text and its narrative as mythically ‘finished’ products is struggled over between an authorial desire for finality and an audience desire for control over the arrangement, (re)configuration and (re)distribution of the text. This struggle takes place across the sites of technological developments of textual control versus full interactivity, and in the realms of both media theory and media law.",
